                Space tourism is a very unique service that ISVR provides. It takes space enthusiasts and newcomers to the outer limits of space where they can view the sphericity of the earth and the blueness of the ocean through the large windows of the capsule, giving them an incredible view of the curvature of the earth, as well as the darkness of space. They can experiment with zero gravity for three minutes before we arrive. It's a priceless opportunity to experience what astronauts feel once they return to Earth safely.

                Many people are passionate about space travel and desire to serve as astronauts, but many lack the funds to do so.however, they can accomplish it at a fairly affordable price with ISVR.

                Virgin Galactic estimates the cost of a single seat at 450,000 dollars, and this is in exchange for travelling to an altitude not exceeding 90 kilometres; whereas, on board our vehicle, we will take you to a higher altitude than the karman line, which is the minimum to be classified as spaceflight. Our vehicle is superior to competitors in terms of the space that each person uses for pleasure, as a particular spot has been provided for each two people individually to heighten the thrill. That you are an astronaut, the price of our flight is 9 times less than that of our competitors. Additionally, it has greater safety precautions because more landing parachutes were added. A backup escape engine has also been installed in the vehicle. As is the case when boarding a civil aeroplane, we aim to make the launch as normal as possible so that our customer does not have to wait a long time after purchasing the ticket. This contrasts with competing companies, which make a period of months between each two journeys.
