                    Our vision for the global student community is to create an open learning platform that is accessible to everyone. At ISVR, we offer applied technology and project-based learning, enabling students to inquire, collaborate, create, and learn while tackling new problems and refining their solutions. Our platform is designed to provide Space Awareness Activities, Educational Programs, and Research & Development of Space Exploration Technologies.
                    <br /><br />
                    One of our key offerings is providing internships to students, where we aim to ignite their young minds. We offer internships in various fields such as Rocketry, Satellites & Communications, Drone technologies, Space medicine, Astronomy, Space research, and Space rover. Through these internships, students get hands-on experience and exposure to the exciting world of space.

                    At ISVR, we are actively involved in space research and development. Currently, our focus is on developing a reusable rocket with open fearing technology. A reusable launch vehicle is designed with components that can be recovered and reflown, allowing for multiple uses while carrying payloads from the surface to outer space. Rocket stages are the primary parts of the launch vehicle that we aim to reuse, and we are also working on SS motors to enhance our capabilities.
